"""
For this problem, given a string (either a word or an entire paragraph), we should remove repeating characters.
We'll continue to define the solution as a function as well.

The function should take in a string parameter, and return a string with all duplicates
removed from the string that we passed in as a parameter.

It should be case sensitive, i.e AaBbCc is considered unique since capitals and lower case can be treated as unique.

Ex:

result = removeDuplicateCharacters('AAaBBBbCCC')

# result should be 'AaBbC'

"""

def removeDuplicateCharacters(stringToClean):
    print(stringToClean)

removeDuplicateCharacters("AAaBBBbCCC")

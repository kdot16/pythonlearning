# Sample Coding Problems

I thought for the `04th` problem set, we could start maybe practicing a few small coding problems. 
I think what you covered in the previous problem sets `01-03` should give you a good handle on how to tackle these. Lmk if you get stuck or run into any  issues!

Each of the problems are in their own `.py` file so feel free to either run them on your machine or use an online editor, you shouldn't need to pull in any libraries for this.

"""
For this problem, we will build a palindrome checker.
We'll also write this solution as a function so you can re-use it multiple times.
The function should return TRUE if it is a palindrome and return FALSE otherwise

A palindrome is a string that reads the same in order and in reverse (we can ignore white spaces).
Ex:

taco cat <-> tac ocat (ignoring white space -> tacocat <-> tacocat)
race car <-> rac ecar (ignoring white space -> racecar <-> racecar)

Or a really long one like:

A man a plan a canal panama <-> (you get the idea.. lol)

Hint:
- Think about how you can leverage your solution for problem #1 where you reversed a string

# Started code to define a function, it just prints for now, but you should define the function to perform it's purpose
# i.e checking if the provided string is a palindrome.
# Should return TRUE if it is a palindrome, FALSE otherwise.

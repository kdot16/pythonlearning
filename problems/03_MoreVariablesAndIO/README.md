## Problem Set 3

Got this assignment from my friend that was doing his master's in cyber-security over at John Jay. This was his first lab assignment for the Python class that he had to take.

**1) Calculate Circle Area, Diameter, Circumference:**
- Allow the user to input an integer of their choice of a circle's radius
- Use the value of 3.14159 for pi
- Formulas
    - Diameter, 2*pi
    - Circumference, 2*pi*r
    - Area, pi*r^2
- Calculate and print results
    - For example, "The diameter of a circle with radius 4 is 8", but this will reflect the number the user type in and the specific calculation.




**2) Determine if number is Odd or Even:**
- Allow the user to input an integer of their choice
- Determine if number is odd or even
- Print message to the user, for example, "5 is an odd number", or "4 is an even number"



**3) Create table of squares and cubes:**
- Calculate the squares and cubes of the numbers 1 through 5
- Print the results in a table
- Hint: Use the tab escape sequence to create the columns  
  number square cube  
1&emsp;1&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1  
2&emsp;4&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8  
3&emsp;9&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;27  
4&emsp;16&emsp;64  
5&emsp;25&emsp;125


**4) Separate digits in an integer:**
- Get a 5 digit integer from the user
- Separate the number into its individual digits
- Hint: The floor division and remainder operators may be helpful
- For example, if 12345 is entered, print 1&nbsp; 2&nbsp; 3&nbsp; 4&nbsp; 5


5) Sort in Ascending Order:**
- Get three different numbers from the user
- Print them in order from smallest to largest
- Test the code with all 6 possible orderings of input numbers

## 02_VariablesControlIO

- `Variables`: We'll work on declaring some variables in the code and perform some operations on them.
- `Control Structures`: Some of these operations also include control structures like if/else statements and loops. 
- `I/O`: Lastly, we'll also do some I/O (input/output) operations with Python on the command line, taking in input from user and storing them variables for later use.

Problem description below for each of the problem files!

`problem1.py` - We'll practice defining some variables and doing some math operations on them.

```
1. Write a program that defines two variables (x,y).
2. Assign an integer value to both x and y that's greater than 101. (i.e x = 123, y = 456)
3. Perform the following operations with x and y:
    3.1 Add, subtract, multiply, divide x by y and print each of the results onto the screen.
4. Re-assign the variable x to a string (i.e x = '123', x = 'hello world', etc...)
    4.1 Do the same thing that you did for 3.1 and print the results onto the screen.
```

`problem2.py` - We'll write a small program here to help you calculate interest rates. This will involve asking for input from the user (i.e how much savings, how much interest rate), as well as working with some control structure (loops)

```
1. Write a program that asks the user for 3 inputs.
    1.1 First input should be how much money is currently in the user's savings account.
    1.2 Second input should be how much is the monthly interest rates on this savings account.
    1.3 Third input should be how many months do you plan on letting this savings mature.

2. Print out the total amount after calculating the interest for the given number of months.
```
